CHANGE OF CONCEPT
You are fighting the boss from the start. Boss spawns minions. With every 3rd wave minions get stronger. On wave 15 all obstacles are removed and boss is the only thing left. 

HP increases with every passed wave. Shop is available once per wave. Instead of HPmps it should have HP heal.
